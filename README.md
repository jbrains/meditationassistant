This application assists with both timed (via duration or ending at a specific time) and
untimed sessions, with numerous customizations, including start/interval/end sounds and
device behavior. It also provides a monthly overview of your progress.

A major feature in this application is the ability to share your sessions online. Though
entirely optional, sharing your progress online adds another dimension to your
accountability. Now that you've gone public, as your meditation streak increases more users
will see it as a goal of their own. Streaks of over one thousand days have been recorded.

Your meditation streak is the number of consecutive days you have recorded at least one
session. As your streak grows, "not breaking the chain" becomes quite important. Soon you
will be meditating once a day, even if it's five or ten minutes out of your schedule.
