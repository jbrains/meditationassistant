# Meditation Assistant [![Donate](http://img.shields.io/liberapay/receives/rocketnine.space.svg?logo=liberapay)](https://liberapay.com/rocketnine.space)

The best meditation timer for Android. Its features (e.g., automatically setting your device to vibrate/silent
while you meditate) and customization (e.g., choosing any file on your device as the start/finish/interval sound
for your session) make it the ideal assistant to your meditation practice.

[MediNET](https://gitlab.com/tslocum/medinet) stores uploaded sessions and provides community-related features.
